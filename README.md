The repository contains files related to my capstone research project at WIU. This study investigates to find the factors that impact household healthcare expenditure in Nepal. The study used Nepal Living Standard Survey data of 2003-2004 and 2010-2011 as well as a linear regression model to analyze the data. Empirical results show that household size and household income positively impact household healthcare expenses. However, some factors such as never-married people, ethnic group, and older age group people (65+) have no positive association to increase the health care cost of the household in Nepal. Thus, the study suggests that there should be a proper policy implementation such as initiating universal health coverage to make the medical expense at a flexible stage for all classes of people.  Also, Government health insurance at a low cost can be a good way to resolve the existing problem.
